# Q22Mini
Small QBus backplane PCB for use with DEC slots

I might do a version enabling use of EDAC slots (which are still made) at some point.

This has not been tested yet (as of Sept. 17th 2022, boards are being ordered, but it'll be a while until I get this built and checked), so proceed at your own risk.

A fair bit of configurability has been provided, as made evident by the documentation. You can daisy chain backplanes, use them standalone, whatever. They're not meant as a replacement for a DEC backplane in an original DEC box.
